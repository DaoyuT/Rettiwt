#Rettiwt- Rebuilding the Twitter Platform
This is the project I carried out during the seven-week [Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program](http://http://www.insightdataengineering.com/) which is designed for people with strong knowledge of computer science fundamentals and coding skills to transition to data engineering by giving them a space to get hands-on experience building out distributed platforms on AWS using open source technologies.
Rettiwt is a twitter-like social media platform that delivers real-time streaming data from twitter api to all the simulated users. Chech it out at [daoyu.online](http://www.daoyu.online/)!
